# Final-Project-Web-Programming
I made this project using PHP, tailwind, and MySQL.
this project is about a vending machine system where I made this project based on real life problem. So there's a vending machine in my University that only allows us to buy 1 item at a time and there's a delay in between transactions, so my concern was the time efficiency. So I made this program that allows us to buy multiple items at once and pay them all at once.
